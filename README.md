Using computer vision techniques in Python, we will identify road lane lines in which autonomous cars must run. This will be a critical part of autonomous cars, as the self-driving cars should not cross itâ€™s lane and should not go in opposite lane to avoid accidents.

## The FER2013 dataset ( facial expression recognition) consists of 48*48 pixel grayscale face images. The images are centered and occupy an equal amount of space. This dataset consist of facial emotions of following categories:

1) :angry
2) :disgust
3) :feat
4) :happy
5) :sad
6) :surprise
7) :natural

## Dependencies
```
pip install numpy 
```
